# Concurrency-and-Deadlock-GUI

This is a small college project regarding the visualization of the concurrency and deadlock algorithms with GUI input and output. Programming Language - JAVA Development kit - Java Development Kit (JDK) Development IDE - Netbeans Minimum requirement to run the program :- JRE 11. Minimum requirements to open the project and review the code :- JDK 11 and Netbeans

Installing JRE :- https://java.com/en/download/ Download and run the installer from the given link. Installing JDK and Netbeans :- Only required if you want to review the code of the program.

 ●Installing JDK :- ● https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html Download the JDK exe file from this link and run the installer. ● Setting     path variable :- To set the PATH variable on Microsoft Windows:

 ●Select Control Panel and then System.

 ●Click Advanced and then Environment Variables.

 ●Add the location of the bin folder of the JDK installation to the PATH variable in System Variables. ● The following is a typical value for the PATH variable:     C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10\bin" Put your jdk version in jdk-xx if it's not 10.

 ●Installing Netbeans :- ● https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html , download and run the Netbeans installer(LTS version) from this site, it will    automatically select the java installation path and you can choose the workspace of your choice or let it be the default one.


Instructions to launch and use our program and use it :-
1. Install Apache NetBeans IDE 11.1 for windows/linux/Mac.
2. Open Apache NetBeans IDE 11.1 and go to open Project and select deadlock file.
3. After opening of deadlock project open all files under that project.
4. run deadlock project. You will see GUI named Concurrency and Deadlock.
5. In GUI, you will find 6 topics which are Bankers algorithm, Semaphore, peterson problem, producer consumer, Dekker algorithm and Test Set lock.
6. By clicking any of that topics, you will see new panel according to topic you selected.
7. In Bankers algorithm, enter two no. for input by cliking on np and nr. After that click input button for taking input of matrix. Enter values of all three matrix by clickig on empty space of column. After that click on Execute button for output.
8. In Semaphore, Enter first process name A or B and Second Process name A or B and then click Execute for output.
9. In Producer Consumer, Enter Queue Size and then click Execute button for Output.
10. In Peterson solution, Enter ID1 and ID2 and then click Execute for output.
11. In Dekker's algorithm, enter two numbers and then click execute for output.
